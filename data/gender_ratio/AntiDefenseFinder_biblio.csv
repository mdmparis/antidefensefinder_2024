To facilitate the exploration of mechanistic, ecological, and evolutionary aspects related to antiphage defense systems, we released DefenseFinder in 2021 (Tesson et al., 2022). DefenseFinder is a bioinformatic program designed for the systematic identification of all known antiphage defense mechanisms. The initial release of DefenseFinder v1.0.0 included 60 systems. Over the past three years, the number of antiphage systems incorporated into DefenseFinder has grown to 152. The increasing number of known systems makes it a challenge to enter the field and makes the interpretation of detections of antiphage systems difficult. Moreover, the rapid development of sequence-based predictions of structures offers novel possibilities of analysis and should be easily available. To overcome these challenges, we present a hub of resources on defense systems including 1) a search tool (DefenseFinder as a web service) 2) a knowledge base, and 3) precomputed databases (results of DefenseFinder ran on RefSeq database, predicted structure database computed with AlphaFold). These pages can be freely accessed for users as a starting point on their journey to better understand a given system. We anticipate that these resources will foster the use of bioinformatics in the study of antiphage systems and will serve the community of researchers who study antiphage systems.

Here, we report functional analyses of the GajA protein from the newly predicted Gabija system. The GajA protein is revealed as a sequence-specific DNA nicking endonuclease unique in that its activity is strictly regulated by nucleotide concentration. NTP and dNTP at physiological concentrations can fully inhibit the robust DNA cleavage activity of GajA. Interestingly, the nucleotide inhibition is mediated by an ATPase-like domain, which usually hydrolyzes ATP to stimulate the DNA cleavage when associated with other nucleases. These features suggest a mechanism of the Gabija defense in which an endonuclease activity is suppressed under normal conditions, while it is activated by the depletion of NTP and dNTP upon the replication and transcription of invading phages. This work highlights a concise strategy to utilize a DNA nicking endonuclease for phage resistance via nucleotide regulation.;21/05/2021;05/08/2024 15:18;05/08/2024 15:18;;5216-5229;;9;49;;Nucleic Acids Res;;;;;;;;eng;;;;;PubMed;

Although the roles of NLRs in eukaryotic immunity are well established, it is unknown whether prokaryotes use similar defense mechanisms. Here, we show that antiviral STAND (Avs) homologs in bacteria and archaea detect hallmark viral proteins, triggering Avs tetramerization and the activation of diverse N-terminal effector domains, including DNA endonucleases, to abrogate infection. Cryo–electron microscopy reveals that Avs sensor domains recognize conserved folds, active-site residues, and enzyme ligands, allowing a single Avs receptor to detect a wide variety of viruses.

These complex systems rely upon production and maintenance of multiple components to achieve antiphage defense. However, the prevalence and effectiveness of minimal, single-component systems that cleave DNA remain unknown. Here, we describe a unique mode of nucleic acid immunity mediated by a single enzyme with nuclease and helicase activities, herein referred to as Nhi (nuclease-helicase immunity). This enzyme provides robust protection against diverse staphylococcal phages and prevents phage DNA accumulation in cells stripped of all other known defenses. Our observations support a model in which Nhi targets and degrades phage-specific replication intermediates. Importantly, Nhi homologs are distributed in diverse bacteria and exhibit functional conservation, highlighting the versatility of such compact weapons as major players in antiphage defense.;13/04/2022;05/08/2024 15:19;05/08/2024 15:19;;570-582.e7;;4;30;;Cell Host Microbe;;;;;;;;eng;;;;;PubMed;

The genomic islands VSP-1 and VSP-2 distinguish El Tor from previous pandemic V. cholerae strains. Using a co-occurrence analysis of VSP genes in >200,000 bacterial genomes we built gene networks to infer biological functions encoded in these islands. This revealed that dncV, a component of the cyclic-oligonucleotide-based anti-phage signalling system (CBASS) anti-phage defence system, co-occurs with an uncharacterized gene vc0175 that we rename avcD for anti-viral cytodine deaminase. We show that AvcD is a deoxycytidylate deaminase and that its activity is post-translationally inhibited by a non-coding RNA named AvcI. AvcID and bacterial homologues protect bacterial populations against phage invasion by depleting free deoxycytidine nucleotides during infection, thereby decreasing phage replication.

The human antiviral factor SAMHD1 takes advantage of this vulnerability in the viral lifecycle, and inhibits viral replication by degrading dNTPs into their constituent deoxynucleosides and inorganic phosphate. Here, we report that bacteria use a similar strategy to defend against bacteriophage infection. We identify a family of defensive bacterial deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) deaminase proteins that convert dCTP into deoxyuracil nucleotides in response to phage infection. We also identify a family of phage resistance genes that encode deoxyguanosine triphosphatase (dGTPase) enzymes, which degrade dGTP into phosphate-free deoxyguanosine and are distant homologues of human SAMHD1. Our results suggest that bacterial defensive proteins deplete specific deoxynucleotides (either dCTP or dGTP) from the nucleotide pool during phage infection, thus starving the phage of an essential DNA building block and halting its replication. Our study shows that manipulation of the dNTP pool is a potent antiviral strategy shared by both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.;2022-08;05/08/2024 15:19;05/08/2024 15:19;05/08/2024 15:19;1200-1209;;8;7;;Nat Microbiol;;;;;;;;en;2022 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited;;;;www.nature.com;

Gabija is one of the most prevalent anti-phage defence systems, occurring in more than 15% of all sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes1,6,7, but the molecular basis of how Gabija defends cells from viral infection remains poorly understood. Here we use X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to define how Gabija proteins assemble into a supramolecular complex of around 500 kDa that degrades phage DNA. Gabija protein A (GajA) is a DNA endonuclease that tetramerizes to form the core of the anti-phage defence complex. Two sets of Gabija protein B (GajB) dimers dock at opposite sides of the complex and create a 4:4 GajA–GajB assembly (hereafter, GajAB) that is essential for phage resistance in vivo. We show that a phage-encoded protein, Gabija anti-defence 1 (Gad1), directly binds to the Gabija GajAB complex and inactivates defence. A cryo-EM structure of the virally inhibited state shows that Gad1 forms an octameric web that encases the GajAB complex and inhibits DNA recognition and cleavage. Our results reveal the structural basis of assembly of the Gabija anti-phage defence complex and define a unique mechanism of viral immune evasion.;2024-01;05/08/2024 15:20;05/08/2024 15:20;05/08/2024 15:20;360-365;;7994;625;;;;;;;;;;en;2023 The Author(s);;;;www.nature.com;

We show here that Hachiman comprises a heterodimeric nuclease-helicase complex, HamAB. HamA, previously a protein of unknown function, is the effector nuclease. HamB is the sensor helicase. HamB constrains HamA activity during surveillance of intact dsDNA. When the HamAB complex detects DNA damage, HamB helicase activity liberates HamA, unleashing nuclease activity. Hachiman activation degrades all DNA in the cell, creating ‘phantom’ cells devoid of both phage and host DNA. We demonstrate Hachiman activation in the absence of phage by treatment with DNA-damaging agents, suggesting that Hachiman responds to aberrant DNA states. Phylogenetic similarities between the Hachiman helicase and eukaryotic enzymes suggest this bacterial immune system has been repurposed for diverse functions across all domains of life.;29/02/2024;05/08/2024 15:20;05/08/2024 15:20;05/08/2024 15:20;;;;;;;;;;;;bioRxiv;;en;© 2024, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

These proteins are common in bacteria and harbour an N-terminal sirtuin (SIR2) domain. In this study we report that DSR proteins degrade nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) during infection, depleting the cell of this essential molecule and aborting phage propagation. Our data show that one of these proteins, DSR2, directly identifies phage tail tube proteins and then becomes an active NADase in Bacillus subtilis. Using a phage mating methodology that promotes genetic exchange between pairs of DSR2-sensitive and DSR2–resistant phages, we further show that some phages express anti-DSR2 proteins that bind and repress DSR2. Finally, we demonstrate that the SIR2 domain serves as an effector NADase in a diverse set of phage defence systems outside the DSR family.

RdrB assembles into a dodecameric cage with catalytic pockets facing outward, while RdrA adopts both autoinhibited tetradecameric and activation-competent heptameric rings. Structural and functional data suggest a model in which RNA is loaded through the bottom section of the RdrA ring and translocated along its inner channel, a process likely coupled with ATP-binding status. Intriguingly, up to twelve RdrA rings can dock one RdrB cage with precise alignments between deaminase catalytic pockets and RNA-translocation channels, indicative of enzymatic coupling of RNA translocation and deamination.

These ATP nucleosidase effectors are widely distributed within multiple bacterial defense systems, including cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiviral signaling systems (CBASS), prokaryotic argonautes, and nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR)-like proteins, and we show that ATP and dATP degradation during infection halts phage propagation. By analyzing homologs of the immune ATP nucleosidase domain, we discover and characterize Detocs, a family of bacterial defense systems with a two-component phosphotransfer-signaling architecture. The immune ATP nucleosidase domain is also encoded within diverse eukaryotic proteins with immune-like architectures, and we show biochemically that eukaryotic homologs preserve the ATP nucleosidase activity.

Despite decades of research on the biosynthesis of msDNA2, the function and physiological roles of retrons have remained unknown. Here we show that Retron-Sen2 of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium encodes an accessory toxin protein, STM14_4640, which we renamed as RcaT. RcaT is neutralized by the reverse transcriptase-msDNA antitoxin complex, and becomes active upon perturbation of msDNA biosynthesis. The reverse transcriptase is required for binding to RcaT, and the msDNA is required for the antitoxin activity. The highly prevalent RcaT-containing retron family constitutes a new type of tripartite DNA-containing toxin-antitoxin system. To understand the physiological roles of such toxin-antitoxin systems, we developed toxin activation-inhibition conjugation (TAC-TIC), a high-throughput reverse genetics approach that identifies the molecular triggers and blockers of toxin-antitoxin systems. By applying TAC-TIC to Retron-Sen2, we identified multiple trigger and blocker proteins of phage origin. We demonstrate that phage-related triggers directly modify the msDNA, thereby activating RcaT and inhibiting bacterial growth. By contrast, prophage proteins circumvent retrons by directly blocking RcaT. Consistently, retron toxin-antitoxin systems act as abortive infection anti-phage defence systems, in line with recent reports3,4. Thus, RcaT retrons are tripartite DNA-regulated toxin-antitoxin systems, which use the reverse transcriptase-msDNA complex both as an antitoxin and as a sensor of phage protein activities.;2022-09;05/08/2024 15:22;05/08/2024 15:22;;144-150;;7925;609;;Nature;;;;;;;;eng;;;;;PubMed;

When assembled with SIR2, HerA forms a hexamer and converts SIR2 from a nuclease to an NAD+ hydrolase, representing an unexpected regulatory mechanism mediated by protein assembly. Furthermore, high concentrations of ATP can inhibit NAD+ hydrolysis by the SIR2-HerA complex.

The cGAS protein is a sensor of cytosolic viral DNA and, upon sensing DNA, it produces a cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP) signalling molecule that binds to the STING protein and activates the immune response3–5. The production of cGAMP has also been detected in bacteria6, and has been shown, in Vibrio cholerae, to activate a phospholipase that degrades the inner bacterial membrane7. However, the biological role of cGAMP signalling in bacteria remains unknown. Here we show that cGAMP signalling is part of an antiphage defence system that is common in bacteria. This system is composed of a four-gene operon that encodes the bacterial cGAS and the associated phospholipase, as well as two enzymes with the eukaryotic-like domains E1, E2 and JAB. We show that this operon confers resistance against a wide variety of phages. Phage infection triggers the production of cGAMP, which—in turn—activates the phospholipase, leading to a loss of membrane integrity and to cell death before completion of phage reproduction. Diverged versions of this system appear in more than 10% of prokaryotic genomes, and we show that variants with effectors other than phospholipase also protect against phage infection. Our results suggest that the eukaryotic cGAS–STING antiviral pathway has ancient evolutionary roots that stem from microbial defences against phages.;2019-10;05/08/2024 15:24;05/08/2024 15:24;05/08/2024 15:24;691-695;;7780;574;;;;;;;;;;en;2019 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited;;;;www.nature.com;

In plants, intracellular pathogen sensing by immune receptors triggers their TIR domains to generate a molecule that is a variant of cyclic ADP-ribose3,4. This molecule is hypothesized to mediate plant cell death through a pathway that has yet to be resolved5. TIR domains have also been shown to be involved in a bacterial anti-phage defence system called Thoeris6, but the mechanism of Thoeris defence remained unknown. Here we show that phage infection triggers Thoeris TIR-domain proteins to produce an isomer of cyclic ADP-ribose. This molecular signal activates a second protein, ThsA, which then depletes the cell of the essential molecule nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and leads to abortive infection and cell death. We also show that, similar to eukaryotic innate immune systems, bacterial TIR-domain proteins determine the immunological specificity to the invading pathogen. Our results describe an antiviral signalling pathway in bacteria, and suggest that the generation of intracellular signalling molecules is an ancient immunological function of TIR domains that is conserved in both plant and bacterial immunity.;2021-12;05/08/2024 15:24;05/08/2024 15:24;05/08/2024 15:24;116-120;;7887;600;;;;;;;;;;en;2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited;;;;www.nature.com;

Here we show that the TIR domain protein of the type II Thoeris defense system in bacteria produces a unique signaling molecule comprising the amino acid histidine conjugated to ADP-ribose (His-ADPR). His-ADPR is generated in response to phage infection and activates the cognate Thoeris effector by binding a Macro domain located at the C-terminus of the effector protein.

Similar to how eukaryotic innate immune systems sense foreign invaders through pathogen-associated molecular patterns4 (PAMPs), many bacterial immune systems that respond to bacteriophage infection require phage-specific triggers to be activated. However, the identities of such triggers and the sensing mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here we identify and investigate the anti-phage function of CapRelSJ46, a fused toxin–antitoxin system that protects Escherichia coli against diverse phages. Using genetic, biochemical and structural analyses, we demonstrate that the C-terminal domain of CapRelSJ46 regulates the toxic N-terminal region, serving as both antitoxin and phage infection sensor. Following infection by certain phages, newly synthesized major capsid protein binds directly to the C-terminal domain of CapRelSJ46 to relieve autoinhibition, enabling the toxin domain to pyrophosphorylate tRNAs, which blocks translation to restrict viral infection. Collectively, our results reveal the molecular mechanism by which a bacterial immune system directly senses a conserved, essential component of phages, suggesting a PAMP-like sensing model for toxin–antitoxin-mediated innate immunity in bacteria. We provide evidence that CapRels and their phage-encoded triggers are engaged in a ‘Red Queen conflict’5, revealing a new front in the intense coevolutionary battle between phages and bacteria. Given that capsid proteins of some eukaryotic viruses are known to stimulate innate immune signalling in mammalian hosts6–10, our results reveal a deeply conserved facet of immunity.;2022-12;05/08/2024 15:26;05/08/2024 15:26;05/08/2024 15:26;132-140;;7938;612;;;;;;;;;;en;2022 The Author(s);;;;www.nature.com;

This search identified homologues of DarTG, a recently discovered family of TA systems whose biological functions and natural activating conditions were unclear. Representatives from two different subfamilies, DarTG1 and DarTG2, strongly protected E. coli MG1655 against different phages. We demonstrate that for each system, infection with either RB69 or T5 phage, respectively, triggers release of the DarT toxin, a DNA ADP-ribosyltransferase, that then modifies viral DNA and prevents replication, thereby blocking the production of mature virions. Further, we isolated phages that have evolved to overcome DarTG defence either through mutations to their DNA polymerase or to an anti-DarT factor, gp61.2, encoded by many T-even phages.

These exemplify two contrasting mechanisms for control of DNA break repair in which the RecBCD complex is either inhibited or co-opted for the benefit of the invading phage. Gp5.9 completely inhibits RecBCD by preventing it from binding to DNA. The RecBCD-gp5.9 structure shows that gp5.9 acts by substrate mimicry, binding predominantly to the RecB arm domain and competing sterically for the DNA binding site. Gp5.9 adopts a parallel coiled-coil architecture that is unprecedented for a natural DNA mimic protein.

In turn, phages encode anti-CBASS (Acb) proteins. We recently uncovered a widespread phage anti-CBASS protein Acb2 that acts as a “sponge” by forming a hexamer complex with three cGAMP molecules. Here, we identified that Acb2 binds and sequesters many CBASS and cGAS-produced cyclic dinucleotides in vitro and inhibits cGAMP-mediated STING activity in human cells. Surprisingly, Acb2 also binds CBASS cyclic trinucleotides 3’3’3’-cyclic AMP-AMP-AMP (cA3) and 3’3’3’-cAAG with high affinity. Structural characterization identified a distinct binding pocket within the Acb2 hexamer that binds two cyclic trinucleotide molecules and another binding pocket that binds to cyclic dinucleotides. Binding in one pocket does not allosterically alter the other, such that one Acb2 hexamer can simultaneously bind two cyclic trinucleotides and three cyclic dinucleotides. Phage-encoded Acb2 provides protection from Type III-C CBASS that uses cA3 signaling molecules in vivo and blocks cA3-mediated activation of the endonuclease effector in vitro. Altogether, Acb2 sequesters nearly all known CBASS signaling molecules through two distinct binding pockets and therefore serves as a broad-spectrum inhibitor of cGAS-based immunity.;01/06/2023;05/08/2024 15:28;05/08/2024 15:28;05/08/2024 15:28;2023.06.01.543220;;;;;bioRxiv;;;;;;;;;;;;;PubMed Central;

However, how phages neutralize these common systems is largely unknown. Here, we show that Thoeris anti-defense proteins Tad1 4 and Tad2 5 both have anti-CBASS activity by simultaneously sequestering CBASS cyclic oligonucleotides. Strikingly, apart from binding Thoeris signals 1’’-3’ and 1’’-2’ gcADPR, Tad1 also binds numerous CBASS CDNs/CTNs with high affinity, inhibiting CBASS systems using these molecules in vivo and in vitro. The hexameric Tad1 has six binding sites for CDNs or gcADPR, which are independent from two high affinity binding sites for CTNs. Tad2 also sequesters various CDNs in addition to gcADPR molecules, inhibiting CBASS systems using these CDNs. However, the binding pockets for CDNs and gcADPR are different in Tad2, whereby a tetramer can bind two CDNs and two gcADPR molecules simultaneously. Taken together, Tad1 and Tad2 are both two-pronged inhibitors that, alongside anti-CBASS protein 2, establish a paradigm of phage proteins that flexibly sequester a remarkable breadth of cyclic nucleotides involved in TIR- and cGAS-based anti-phage immunity.;16/11/2023;05/08/2024 15:28;05/08/2024 15:28;05/08/2024 15:28;;;;;;;;;;;;bioRxiv;;en;© 2023, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

In vertebrate animals, cGAS is activated by DNA to produce cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP)4,5, which leads to the expression of antimicrobial genes6,7. In bacteria, cyclic dinucleotide (CDN)-based anti-phage signalling systems (CBASS) have been discovered8–11. These systems are composed of cGAS-like enzymes and various effector proteins that kill bacteria on phage infection, thereby stopping phage spread. Of the CBASS systems reported, approximately 39% contain Cap2 and Cap3, which encode proteins with homology to ubiquitin conjugating (E1/E2) and deconjugating enzymes, respectively8,12. Although these proteins are required to prevent infection of some bacteriophages8, the mechanism by which the enzymatic activities exert an anti-phage effect is unknown. Here we show that Cap2 forms a thioester bond with the C-terminal glycine of cGAS and promotes conjugation of cGAS to target proteins in a process that resembles ubiquitin conjugation. The covalent conjugation of cGAS increases the production of cGAMP. Using a genetic screen, we found that the phage protein Vs.4 antagonized cGAS signalling by binding tightly to cGAMP (dissociation constant of approximately 30 nM) and sequestering it. A crystal structure of Vs.4 bound to cGAMP showed that Vs.4 formed a hexamer that was bound to three molecules of cGAMP. These results reveal a ubiquitin-like conjugation mechanism that regulates cGAS activity in bacteria and illustrates an arms race between bacteria and viruses through controlling CDN levels.;2023-04;05/08/2024 15:28;05/08/2024 15:28;05/08/2024 15:28;326-331;;7956;616;;;;;;;;;;en;2023 The Author(s);;;;www.nature.com;

Many Abi systems utilize bespoke cyclic nucleotide immune messengers generated upon infection to mobilize cognate death effectors. Here, we identify a family of bacteriophage nucleotidyltransferases (NTases) that synthesize competitor cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) ligands and inhibit TIR NADase effectors activated via a linked STING CDN sensor domain (TIR-STING). Through a functional screen of NTase-adjacent phage genes, we uncover candidate inhibitors of cell suicide induced by heterologous expression of tonically active TIR-STING. Among these, we demonstrate that a virus MazG-like nucleotide pyrophosphohydrolase, Atd1, depletes the starvation alarmone (p)ppGpp, revealing a potential role for the alarmone-activated host toxin MazF as an executioner of TIR-driven Abi.

Many defense systems were recently shown to deplete cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) in response to infection, by breaking NAD+ to ADP-ribose (ADPR) and nicotinamide. It was demonstrated that NAD+ depletion during infection deprives the phage from this essential molecule and impedes phage replication. Here we show that a substantial fraction of phages possess enzymatic pathways allowing reconstitution of NAD+ from its degradation products in infected cells. We describe NAD+ reconstitution pathway 1 (NARP1), a two-step pathway in which one enzyme phosphorylates ADPR to generate ADPR-pyrophosphate (ADPR-PP), and the second enzyme conjugates ADPR- PP and nicotinamide to generate NAD+. Phages encoding the NARP1 pathway can overcome a diverse set of defense systems, including Thoeris, DSR1, DSR2, SIR2-HerA, and SEFIR, all of which deplete NAD+ as part of their defensive mechanism. Phylogenetic analyses show that NARP1 is primarily encoded on phage genomes, suggesting a phage- specific function in countering bacterial defenses. A second pathway, NARP2, allows phages to overcome bacterial defenses by building NAD+ via metabolites different than ADPR-PP. Our findings report a unique immune evasion strategy where viruses rebuild molecules depleted by defense systems, thus overcoming host immunity.;13/02/2024;05/08/2024 15:29;05/08/2024 15:29;05/08/2024 15:29;;;;;;;;;;;;bioRxiv;;en;© 2024, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

Bacteria express various defense mechanisms, such as CRISPR-Cas, restriction-modification systems, and SOS-response genes, to prevent the invasion of mobile elements. Yet, plasmids efficiently and robustly overcome these defenses during conjugation. Here, we show that the leading region of plasmids, which is the first to enter recipient cells, is a hotspot for an extensive repertoire of anti-defense systems, encoding anti-CRISPR, anti-restriction, anti-SOS, and other counter-defense proteins. We further demonstrate that focusing on these specific functional regions can lead to the discovery of diverse anti-defense genes. Promoters known to allow expression from ssDNA were prevalent in the leading regions, potentially facilitating rapid protection against bacterial immunity in the early stages of plasmid invasion. These findings reveal a new facet of plasmid dissemination and provide theoretical foundations for developing conjugative delivery systems for natural microbial communities.;16/02/2023;05/08/2024 15:29;05/08/2024 15:29;05/08/2024 15:29;;;;;;;;;;;;bioRxiv;;en;© 2023, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

Type III CRISPR systems detect viral RNA, resulting in the activation of two regions of the Cas10 protein: an HD nuclease domain (which degrades viral DNA)1,2 and a cyclase domain (which synthesizes cyclic oligoadenylates from ATP)3–5. Cyclic oligoadenylates in turn activate defence enzymes with a CRISPR-associated Rossmann fold domain6, sculpting a powerful antiviral response7–10 that can drive viruses to extinction7,8. Cyclic nucleotides are increasingly implicated in host–pathogen interactions11–13. Here we identify a new family of viral anti-CRISPR (Acr) enzymes that rapidly degrade cyclic tetra-adenylate (cA4). The viral ring nuclease AcrIII-1 is widely distributed in archaeal and bacterial viruses and in proviruses. The enzyme uses a previously unknown fold to bind cA4 specifically, and a conserved active site to rapidly cleave this signalling molecule, allowing viruses to neutralize the type III CRISPR defence system. The AcrIII-1 family has a broad host range, as it targets cA4 signalling molecules rather than specific CRISPR effector proteins.

As these effectors are not specific for invading nucleic acids, a prolonged activation can result in cell dormancy or death. Some archaeal species encode a specialised ring nuclease enzyme (Crn1) to degrade cyclic tetra-adenylate (cA4) and deactivate the ancillary nucleases. Some archaeal viruses and bacteriophage encode a potent ring nuclease anti-CRISPR, AcrIII-1, to rapidly degrade cA4 and neutralise immunity. Homologues of this enzyme (named Crn2) exist in type III CRISPR systems but are uncharacterised. Here we describe an unusual fusion between cA4-activated CRISPR ribonuclease (Csx1) and a cA4-degrading ring nuclease (Crn2) from Marinitoga piezophila. The protein has two binding sites that compete for the cA4 ligand, a canonical cA4-activated ribonuclease activity in the Csx1 domain and a potent cA4 ring nuclease activity in the C-terminal Crn2 domain. The cA4 binding affinities and activities of the two constituent enzymes in the fusion protein may have evolved to ensure a robust but time-limited cOA-activated ribonuclease activity that is finely tuned to cA4 levels as a second messenger of infection.;19/06/2020;05/08/2024 15:30;05/08/2024 15:30;05/08/2024 15:30;6149-6156;;11;48;;Nucleic Acids Research;Fuse to defuse;;;;;;;;;;;;Silverchair;

The relevant gene, ardB, was located in the leading region of pKM101, about 7 kb from oriT. The nucleotide sequence of ardB was determined, and an appropriate polypeptide was identified in maxicells of Escherichia coli. Like ArdA, ArdB efficiently inhibits restriction by members of the three known families of type I systems of E. coli and only slightly affects the type II enzyme, EcoRI. However, in contrast to ArdA, ArdB is ineffective against the modification activity of the type I (EcoK) system. Comparison of deduced amino acid sequences of ArdA and ArdB revealed only one small region of similarity (nine residues), suggesting that this region may be somehow involved in the interaction with the type I restriction systems. We also found that the expression of both ardA and ardB genes is controlled jointly by two pKM101-encoded proteins, ArdK and ArdR, with molecular weights of about 15,000 and 20,000, respectively. The finding that the sequences immediately upstream of ardA and ardB share about 94% identity over 218 bp suggests that their expression may be controlled by ArdK and ArdR at the transcriptional level. Deletion studies and promoter probe analysis of these sequences revealed the regions responsible for the action of ArdK and ArdR as regulatory proteins. We propose that both types of antirestriction proteins may play a pivotal role in overcoming the host restriction barrier by self-transmissible broad-host-range plasmids. It seems likely that the ardKR-dependent regulatory system serves in this case as a genetic switch that controls the expression of plasmid-encoded antirestriction functions during mating.;1993-08;05/08/2024 15:31;05/08/2024 15:31;;4843-4850;;15;175;;J Bacteriol;;;;;;;;eng;;;;;PubMed;

However, practical use of profile HMM methods has been hindered by the computational expense of existing software implementations. Here I describe an acceleration heuristic for profile HMMs, the “multiple segment Viterbi” (MSV) algorithm. The MSV algorithm computes an optimal sum of multiple ungapped local alignment segments using a striped vector-parallel approach previously described for fast Smith/Waterman alignment. MSV scores follow the same statistical distribution as gapped optimal local alignment scores, allowing rapid evaluation of significance of an MSV score and thus facilitating its use as a heuristic filter. I also describe a 20-fold acceleration of the standard profile HMM Forward/Backward algorithms using a method I call “sparse rescaling”. These methods are assembled in a pipeline in which high-scoring MSV hits are passed on for reanalysis with the full HMM Forward/Backward algorithm. This accelerated pipeline is implemented in the freely available HMMER3 software package. Performance benchmarks show that the use of the heuristic MSV filter sacrifices negligible sensitivity compared to unaccelerated profile HMM searches. HMMER3 is substantially more sensitive and 100- to 1000-fold faster than HMMER2. HMMER3 is now about as fast as BLAST for protein searches.;20/10/2011;05/08/2024 15:32;05/08/2024 15:32;05/08/2024 15:32;e1002195;;10;7;;PLOS Computational Biology;;;;;;;;en;;;;;PLoS Journals;

Integrons embedded within mobile genetic elements often contain multiple antibiotic resistance genes that they spread among nosocomial pathogens and contribute to the current antibiotic resistance crisis. However, most integrons are presumably sedentary and encode a much broader diversity of functions. IntegronFinder is a widely used software to identify novel integrons in bacterial genomes, but has aged and lacks some useful functionalities to handle very large datasets of draft genomes or metagenomes. Here, we present IntegronFinder version 2. We have updated the code, improved its efficiency and usability, adapted the output to incomplete genome data, and added a few novel functions. We describe these changes and illustrate the relevance of the program by analyzing the distribution of integrons across more than 20,000 fully sequenced genomes.

The method can be assessed online using the Galaxy workflow or locally using a standalone software. The latter version allows to modify the models of the module (i.e., to change the expected components, their number, and their organization).CONJscan identifies conjugative systems, but when the mobile genetic element is integrative (ICE), one often also wants to delimit it from the chromosome. We present a method, with a script, to use the results of CONJscan and comparative genomics to delimit ICE in chromosomes. The method provides a visual representation of the ICE location.

Thus, several different trimming strategies have been developed for identifying and removing these sites prior to phylogenetic inference. However, a recent study reported that doing so can worsen inference, underscoring the need for alternative alignment trimming strategies. Here, we introduce ClipKIT, an alignment trimming software that, rather than identifying and removing putatively phylogenetically uninformative sites, instead aims to identify and retain parsimony-informative sites, which are known to be phylogenetically informative. To test the efficacy of ClipKIT, we examined the accuracy and support of phylogenies inferred from 14 different alignment trimming strategies, including those implemented in ClipKIT, across nearly 140,000 alignments from a broad sampling of evolutionary histories. Phylogenies inferred from ClipKIT-trimmed alignments are accurate, robust, and time saving. Furthermore, ClipKIT consistently outperformed other trimming methods across diverse datasets, suggesting that strategies based on identifying and retaining parsimony-informative sites provide a robust framework for alignment trimming.;02/12/2020;05/08/2024 15:33;05/08/2024 15:33;05/08/2024 15:33;e3001007;;12;18;;PLOS Biology;ClipKIT;;;;;;;en;;;;;PLoS Journals;

Fast programs exist, but due to inherent heuristics to find optimal trees, it is not clear whether the best tree is found. Thus, there is need for additional approaches that employ different search strategies to find ML trees and that are at the same time as fast as currently available ML programs. We show that a combination of hill-climbing approaches and a stochastic perturbation method can be time-efficiently implemented. If we allow the same CPU time as RAxML and PhyML, then our software IQ-TREE found higher likelihoods between 62.2% and 87.1% of the studied alignments, thus efficiently exploring the tree-space. If we use the IQ-TREE stopping rule, RAxML and PhyML are faster in 75.7% and 47.1% of the DNA alignments and 42.2% and 100% of the protein alignments, respectively.

Our lab recently identified the first examples of phage-borne anti-CRISPR genes that encode protein inhibitors of the type I-F CRISPR-Cas system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A key question arising from this work was whether there are other types of anti-CRISPR genes. In the current work, we address this question by demonstrating that some of the same phages carrying type I-F anti-CRISPR genes also possess genes that mediate inhibition of the type I-E CRISPR-Cas system of P. aeruginosa. We have discovered four distinct families of these type I-E anti-CRISPR genes. These genes do not inhibit the type I-F CRISPR-Cas system of P. aeruginosa or the type I-E system of Escherichia coli. Type I-E and I-F anti-CRISPR genes are located at the same position in the genomes of a large group of related P. aeruginosa phages, yet they are found in a variety of combinations and arrangements. We have also identified functional anti-CRISPR genes within nonprophage Pseudomonas genomic regions that are likely mobile genetic elements. This work emphasizes the potential importance of anti-CRISPR genes in phage evolution and lateral gene transfer and supports the hypothesis that more undiscovered families of anti-CRISPR genes exist. Finally, we provide the first demonstration that the type I-E CRISPR-Cas system of P. aeruginosa is naturally active without genetic manipulation, which contrasts with E. coli and other previously characterized I-E systems. IMPORTANCE The CRISPR-Cas system is an adaptive immune system possessed by the majority of prokaryotic organisms to combat potentially harmful foreign genetic elements. This study reports the discovery of bacteriophage-encoded anti-CRISPR genes that mediate inhibition of a well-studied subtype of CRISPR-Cas system. The four families of anti-CRISPR genes described here, which comprise only the second group of anti-CRISPR genes to be identified, encode small proteins that bear no sequence similarity to previously studied phage or bacterial proteins. Anti-CRISPR genes represent a newly discovered and intriguing facet of the ongoing evolutionary competition between phages and their bacterial hosts.;15/04/2014;05/08/2024 15:34;05/08/2024 15:34;;e00896;;2;5;;mBio;;;;;;;;eng;;;;;PubMed;

However, fundamental knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying phage–host interactions is mostly confined to a few traditional model systems and did not keep pace with the recent massive expansion of the field. The true potential of molecular biology encoded by these viruses has therefore remained largely untapped, and phages for therapy or other applications are often still selected empirically. We therefore sought to promote a systematic exploration of phage–host interactions by composing a well-assorted library of 68 newly isolated phages infecting the model organism Escherichia coli that we share with the community as the BASEL (BActeriophage SElection for your Laboratory) collection. This collection is largely representative of natural E. coli phage diversity and was intensively characterized phenotypically and genomically alongside 10 well-studied traditional model phages. We experimentally determined essential host receptors of all phages, quantified their sensitivity to 11 defense systems across different layers of bacterial immunity, and matched these results to the phages’ host range across a panel of pathogenic enterobacterial strains. Clear patterns in the distribution of phage phenotypes and genomic features highlighted systematic differences in the potency of different immunity systems and suggested the molecular basis of receptor specificity in several phage groups. Our results also indicate strong trade-offs between fitness traits like broad host recognition and resistance to bacterial immunity that might drive the divergent adaptation of different phage groups to specific ecological niches. We envision that the BASEL collection will inspire future work exploring the biology of bacteriophages and their hosts by facilitating the discovery of underlying molecular mechanisms as the basis for an effective translation into biotechnology or therapeutic applications.;16/11/2021;05/08/2024 15:35;05/08/2024 15:35;05/08/2024 15:35;e3001424;;11;19;;PLOS Biology;;;;;;;;en;;;;;PLoS Journals;

However, successful application of these phages in biocontrol depends on understanding of their biology and stability in different environments. In this study, we isolated a novel virus from garden soil in Wrocław (Poland) and named it ‘Thurquoise’. The genome of that phage was sequenced and assembled into a single continuous contig with 226 predicted protein-coding genes and 18 tRNAs. The cryo-electron microscopy revealed that Thurquoise has complex virion structure typical for the Bastillevirinae family. Confirmed hosts include selected bacteria from the Bacillus cereus group–specifically B. thuringiensis (isolation host) and B. mycoides, but susceptible strains display different efficiency of plating (EOP). The eclipse and latent periods of Thurquoise in the isolation host last ~ 50 min and ~ 70 min, respectively. The phage remains viable for more than 8 weeks in variants of the SM buffer with magnesium, calcium, caesium, manganese or potassium and can withstand numerous freeze–thaw cycles if protected by the addition of 15% glycerol or, to a lesser extent, 2% gelatine. Thus, with proper buffer formulation, this virus can be safely stored in common freezers and refrigerators for a considerable time. The Thurquoise phage is the exemplar of a new candidate species within the Caeruleovirus genus in the Bastillevirinae subfamily of the Herelleviridae family with a genome, morphology and biology typical for these taxa.;14/03/2023;05/08/2024 15:35;05/08/2024 15:35;05/08/2024 15:35;1120147;;;14;;Front Microbiol;;;;;;;;;;;;;PubMed Central;

In response to this immunity, many phages have anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins that inhibit CRISPR-Cas targeting. To date, anti-CRISPR genes have primarily been discovered in phage or prophage genomes. Here, we uncovered acr loci on plasmids and other conjugative elements present in Firmicutes, using the Listeria acrIIA1 gene as a marker. The four identified genes, found in Listeria, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Staphylococcus genomes, can inhibit Type II-A SpyCas9 or SauCas9, and are thus named acrIIA16-19. In Enterococcus faecalis, conjugation of a Cas9-targeted plasmid was enhanced by anti-CRISPRs derived from Enterococcus conjugative elements, highlighting a role for Acrs in the dissemination of plasmids. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation showed that each Acr protein interacts with Cas9, and Cas9:Acr complexes were unable to cleave DNA. Northern blotting suggests that these anti-CRISPRs manipulate sgRNA loading or stability. Mirroring their activity in bacteria, AcrIIA16 and AcrIIA17 provide robust and highly potent broad-spectrum inhibition of distinct Cas9 proteins in human cells (e.g. SpyCas9, SauCas9, SthCas9, NmeCas9, CjeCas9).

Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods.

Upon infection, a temperate phage can either kill the host cell or be maintained as a prophage. In this state, the bacteria carrying the prophage is at risk of superinfection, where another phage injects its genetic material and competes for host cell resources. To avoid this, many phages have evolved mechanisms that alter the bacteria and make it resistant to phage superinfection. The mechanisms underlying these phentoypic conversions and the fitness consequences for the host are poorly understood, and systematic studies of superinfection exclusion mechanisms are lacking. In this study, we examined a wide range of Pseudomonas aeruginosa phages and found that they mediate superinfection exclusion through a variety of mechanisms, some of which affected the type IV pilus and O-antigen, and others that functioned inside the cell. The strongest resistance mechanism was a surface modification that we showed is cost-free for the bacterial host in a natural soil environment and in a Caenorhabditis. elegans infection model.

It appears that the cyclic-AMP-CRP regulatory system has been adapted to respond to distinct external and internal inputs across a broad sensitivity range that is, at least in part, determined by bacterial lifestyles.;2014-04;05/08/2024 15:40;05/08/2024 15:40;;01-juil;;100;18;;Curr Opin Microbiol;Cyclic-AMP and bacterial cyclic-AMP receptor proteins revisited;;;;;;;eng;;;;;PubMed;
WNW3CBMY;journalArticle;2010;Linder, Jürgen U.;cGMP production in bacteria;Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry;;1573-4919;10.1007/s11010-009-0321-0;;Production of cGMP in bacteria has been studied since the early 1970s. From the beginning on it proved to be a challenging topic. In Escherichia coli the cGMP levels were two orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding cAMP levels. Furthermore, no specific cGMP receptor protein was identified in the bacterium and a physiological role of cGMP in the bacterium was not substantiated. Consequently in 1977, compelling evidence was given that cGMP is a by-product of E. coli adenylate cyclase in vivo. This may be the reason why also work on cGMP in other bacteria like Bacillus licheniformis and Caulobacter crescentus was not pursued any further. However, recent study on cGMP and guanylate cyclase in the cyanobacterium Synechocysis PCC 6803 brought cGMP signaling in bacteria back to attention. In Synechocystis cGMP levels are of similar magnitude as those of cAMP and deletion of the cya2 gene markedly reduced the amount of cGMP without affecting cAMP. A few months ago the Cya2 gene product has been biochemically and structurally characterized. It behaves as a specific guanylate cyclase in vitro and a single amino acid substitution transforms the enzyme into a specific adenylate cyclase. These data point toward the existence of a true bacterial cGMP-signaling pathway, which needs to be explored and established by future experiments.;2010-01;05/08/2024 15:40;05/08/2024 15:40;;215-219;;01-févr;334;;Mol Cell Biochem;;;;;;;;eng;;;;;PubMed;

Using a database of 67,715 newly predicted protein structures from 4,463 eukaryotic viral species, we found that 62% of viral proteins are evolutionarily young and lack homologs in the Alphafold database2,3. Among the 38% of more ancient viral proteins, many have non-viral structural homologs that revealed surprising similarities between human pathogens and their eukaryotic hosts. Structural comparisons suggested putative functions for >25% of unannotated viral proteins, including those with roles in the evasion of innate immunity. In particular, RNA ligase T- (ligT) like phosphodiesterases were found to resemble phage-encoded proteins that hydrolyze the host immune-activating cyclic dinucleotides 3’3’ and 2’3’ cyclic G-A monophosphate (cGAMP). Experimental analysis showed that ligT homologs encoded by avian poxviruses likewise hydrolyze 2’3’ cGAMP, showing that ligT-mediated targeting of cGAMP is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of immune evasion present in both bacteriophage and eukaryotic viruses. Together, the viral protein structural database and analytics presented here afford new opportunities to identify mechanisms of virus-host interactions that are common across the virome.;23/01/2024;05/08/2024 16:28;05/08/2024 16:28;05/08/2024 16:28;;;;;;;;;;;;bioRxiv;;en;© 2024, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.
